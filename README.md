# Gear-Box-Fault-Diagnosis-Data-Set
: Faulty and healthy gear box Data sets need to be analyzed in detail. Here, we created this dataset for those who do research in wind turbine gearbox fault diagnosis.
Data Type:  Multivariate
Task:  Classification
Attribute Type:      Integer
Number of Instances (records in your data set): 2021119
Number of Attributes (fields within each record): 4
Relevant Information:  Data set includes Healthy and Broken Tooth data set. Data set has been recorded under variation of load from '0' to '90' percent with 4 different sensors in four directions. Ten different text files are available for each case (Healthy as well as Broken Tooth).
Total Instances in Healthy case: 10,15,808 (of 10 txt files)
Total Instances in Broken Tooth case: 10,05,311 (of 10 txt files).
Meaning of the txt File naming: Example 'b30hz0.txt'= b stands for broken tooth, 30hz stands for recording frequency, 0 stands for loading condition
Attribute Information: Type of Gear box Condition: 1) Healthy condition and 2) Broken Tooth condition
Attribute#1: Sensor#1 data
Attribute#2: Sensor#2 data
